### Problem

There are two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be $O(log(m+n))$.

Example 1:

    nums1 = [1, 3]
    nums2 = [2]

    The median is 2.0

Example 2:

    nums1 = [1, 2]
    nums2 = [3, 4]

    The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
