### As a Road-tripper…
---

I am a road trip enthusiast. Although I got my driver licence in the United States in 2013, I have driven more than 60,000 miles, and this number is still increasing. I have finished several road trips and list some major trips below, among which the Route 66 is the one I like most.

- **Route 66**

	It took **me** about two weeks (yes, alone). It was from Columbia, MO to Los Angeles via the historical route 66, then went north up to San Francisco, then went back to Columbia MO via I-80. Click [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrUoG5h5730) or [YouKu](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XODYyNzQ4NDAw.html) or see below for a video of my trip.

- **Columbia MO to New York**

	Three times driving between Columbia and New York.

- **Columbia MO to Key West FL**

	Twice driving between Columbia and Florida.

- **Columbia MO to Chicago IL**

	A lot of times between Columbia and Chicago.

- **Columbia MO to Dallas TX**

	Once driving between Columbia and Dallas.

I have two garden spots in Columbia MO provided by Community Garden Coalition. When I got the two spots at the beginning of 2016, they were covered with weeds and grasses. It took me a month to remove and clean them all with the help of my wife and my friends. We have some green vegetables, watermelons and  tomatoes planted and harvested a lot.

It was really hard to maintain the gardens perfect in my spare time, but I really enjoyed working on my plants, watching them growing, which gives me a great sense of achievement.
