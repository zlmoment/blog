### Honors & Awards
---

**Winner, IBM Smart Planet Program**

- Our group project “Real-time Emotion Analysis On Twitter” was selected for funding from IBM out of 15 teams. “Smarter Planet” themes include energy, sustainability, analytics, water, commerce and public safety.
- Our project is in line with the topic “Smarter Commerce” in IBM Smarter Planet. It can help companies to optimize their marketing processes by tracking online behavior to inform marketing decisions, and capturing data from customers’ interactions for real-time marketing. It provides a way for them to do better business.
