### Research Area
---

My current research area is about computational biology using deep learning and AI. We study and apply machine learning algorithms to solve problems in this area. The topic I am working on includes:

- Protein Tertiary Structure Prediction
- Protein Loop Modeling
- Protein Secondary Structure Prediction
- Protein Sequence Profiling
- Contact Prediction
- Deep Learning Techniques on These Topics


### Projects Details
---

**[MUFOLD2: A Solution for Protein 3D Structure Prediction](http://mufold.org/index.html)**

MUFOLD is a comprehensive platform to do protein tertiary structure prediction. MUFOLD2 is an objected oriented version of original MUFOLD. We are going to provide a platform for computational protein structure prediction with efficiency and accuracy to help experimental biologists understand structures and functions of the proteins of their interest thereby facilitating hypotheses for experimental design.

- MUFOLD2 Structure Prediction predicts the tertiary structure given a protein - sequence based on template.
- MUFOLD2 Secondary Structure Prediction predicts the secondary structure - prediction using hybrid methods given a protein sequence.
- MUFOLD2 Loop Modeling predicts the loop area or gap region in a give protein - based on dynamic database searching and energy.
- MUFOLD2 Quality Assessment evaluates the quality of decoys and do model - selection based on machine learning techniques.
